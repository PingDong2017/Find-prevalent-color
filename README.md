"# Find-prevalent-color" 

Find the top three prevalent colors in images.

It's tested on python 3.5.4, opencv 3.4.0., numpy 1.13.0, and scipy 1.0.0.

To find more accurate color centroids of each cluster, LAB color space can be used instead of RGB. RGB color space is not good for distance metric between colors.
